## About

This program simply adds a new page to the backs of multiple choice scanforms for written and essay questions. It is primarily made with ZipGrade in mind. Other services, such as Akindi, are untested, but it should work.

**Example Input and Output files:**

## Usage

> **Note:** Step 1 is optional if you don't want student names and other information pre-printed on the sheets, but at that point, you may as well just merge the two PDF files manually in Adobe Acrobat.

### Step 1: Create a class on ZipGrade and import a classlist from your LMS ("eLearn")
See: [https://support.zipgrade.com/hc/en-us/articles/202512649-How-do-I-enter-edit-import-students](https://support.zipgrade.com/hc/en-us/articles/202512649-How-do-I-enter-edit-import-students)

### Step 2: Create a custom answer sheet on ZipGrade
See: [https://support.zipgrade.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001172783-How-do-I-create-custom-answer-sheets](https://support.zipgrade.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001172783-How-do-I-create-custom-answer-sheets)

### Step 3: Download the custom Answer Sheet Packets
(ZipGrade → Classes → Answer Sheet Packets). Student names, the quiz/exam name, and all other information will already be filled out.

### Step 4: Prepare your files
Take your Answer Sheet Packets from ZipGrade and the Written Sheet PDF that you created. Go to:  
[https://calebhendren.github.io/zipmerge/](https://calebhendren.github.io/zipmerge/)

### Step 5: Merge your files
1. Select the Answer Sheet Packets as the **Bubble Sheet**
2. Select the Written Sheet as the **Written Answer Sheet**
3. Click **Merge**
